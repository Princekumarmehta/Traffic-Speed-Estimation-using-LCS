Time Complexity:

calculate_spatial_proximity: O(1) due to constant-time arithmetic operations.
calculate_lcs: O(m * n) due to the dynamic programming approach involving a 2D table.
estimate_speed: O(1) due to simple arithmetic operations.
Overall Time Complexity: O(m * n) as the LCS calculation dominates.


Space Complexity:

calculate_lcs: O(m * n) for the 2D table used in dynamic programming.
Overall Space Complexity: O(m * n) as the LCS table is the primary space consumer.
Key Points:

The LCS calculation is the most time-consuming part of the code.
The LCS calculation also dictates the overall space usage.
The other functions have negligible impact on overall complexity.
