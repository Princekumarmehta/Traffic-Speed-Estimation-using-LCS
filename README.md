<h1>Time Complexity:</h1>

<p>calculate_spatial_proximity: O(1) due to constant-time arithmetic operations.</hr>
calculate_lcs: O(m * n) due to the dynamic programming approach involving a 2D table.</hr>
estimate_speed: O(1) due to simple arithmetic operations. </hr>
Overall Time Complexity: O(m * n) as the LCS calculation dominates. </hr>
</p>
</hr>
</hr>

<h1>Space Complexity:</h1>

<p> calculate_lcs: O(m * n) for the 2D table used in dynamic programming.</hr>
Overall Space Complexity: O(m * n) as the LCS table is the primary space consumer.
  </p>
</hr>
<h1>Key Points:</h1>
  <ul>
<li>The LCS calculation is the most time-consuming part of the code.</li>
<li>The LCS calculation also dictates the overall space usage.</li>
<li>The other functions have negligible impact on overall complexity.</li>
</ul>
